# Secure Watcher

This zkgraph watches for activities which are similar to compromise of Private Key like more than 2 transactions of transfer of popular ERC20 Token in the same block to some unknown address.
It will trigger the smart contract which were approved of the ERC20 Tokens and will transfer all the token to the Backup address upon the trigger.

## Idea

It is an idea which can be a usecase once the project goes live as we have to actually see the time that will be taken by the node to trigger it and ways on how to set a very high gas fees so that the transaction is included in the very next block.

## Future

Also we would love to get any feature that will also help us transfer our Native Eth Token if we already sign a transaction to transfer usual average balance of the account. A meta transaction that can be triggered using the zkautomation.
